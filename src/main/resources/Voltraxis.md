# Voltraxis



###### A cybernetic war construct designed to dominate any battlefield it occupies. Voltraxis thrives on overwhelming foes with barrages of electric orbs and a relentless surge of power. With hidden cores that accelerate its strength and shield its body, challengers must dismantle its defenses before forcing it into a vulnerable state. When its systems overload, Voltraxis enters an unstable Overhaul mode — faster, stronger, and far more dangerous.
